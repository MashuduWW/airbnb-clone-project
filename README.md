## Feature Breakdown

**User Management**

This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It supports authentication, role-based access, and account settings, forming the foundation for personalized experiences and secure interactions.

**Property Management**

Hosts can list properties with relevant details like pricing, location, amenities, and availability. This functionality enables the core business model of offering spaces for rent and ensures data is well-structured and searchable.

**Booking System**

Users can browse listings, check availability, and make reservations with date and payment integration. This is the heart of the application, simulating real-life booking workflows and transactional processes.

**Review and Rating System**

After their stay, users can leave reviews and rate properties. This feature helps build trust, improve service quality, and offers valuable feedback for both users and hosts.

**Search and Filter Functionality**

Users can search for properties based on parameters like location, price range, amenities, and availability. It enhances user experience by enabling fast and relevant discovery of listings.

**Secure API and Authentication Layer**

Includes measures like token-based authentication, input validation, and authorization policies to protect user data and enforce proper access control. This is critical for preventing unauthorized access and ensuring secure interactions.

**Database Architecture & Management**

The project emphasizes relational database design using MySQL, with well-defined entities such as Users, Properties, and Bookings. A strong schema underpins the integrity and scalability of the application.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

Learners will set up pipelines using GitHub Actions or Docker to automate testing, integration, and deployment. This ensures code quality, reduces human error, and accelerates delivery cycles.

**Team Role Documentation and Collaboration**

Each team member’s responsibilities are documented, fostering clear communication and simulating real-world software team environments. This encourages collaboration and workflow efficiency.

## API Security Overview

#### Authentication

Ensures users prove their identity using login credentials (e.g., email and password) before accessing the system. Common implementations include JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based auth.

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Protects user accounts from unauthorized access and ensures that only verified users can perform actions like booking or listing properties.

#### Authorization

Determines what a user is allowed to do after they’re authenticated. For instance, a host can add properties, but a guest cannot.

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Prevents privilege escalation—ensures that users can only perform actions that match their roles, protecting system integrity and user data.

#### Rate Limiting

Restricts how many times a user or IP can hit the API within a certain time period to prevent abuse.

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Mitigates brute-force attacks and protects server resources from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, maintaining app performance and availability.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

All input from users is checked and cleaned to prevent malicious code (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Secures the backend and database from attacks that could expose or manipulate sensitive information.

#### Data Encryption

Sensitive data such as passwords and payment info are encrypted both at rest (in the database) and in transit (via HTTPS).

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Prevents unauthorized interception or access to private data, especially during transactions or login.

#### Secure Payment Handling

If the app processes payments, it should use secure third-party services (e.g., Stripe) with tokenized transactions.

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Protects financial data, prevents fraud, and ensures compliance with standards like PCI-DSS.

#### Secure Session Management

Manages user sessions securely—timeouts, invalidations, and secure cookies to avoid hijacking.

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Reduces the risk of unauthorized access through stolen or hijacked sessions, especially on shared or public devices.

#### Logging and Monitoring 
Tracks security-related events like login attempts and API failures.

**Why it’s crucial:**  
Helps detect suspicious activity early, enabling rapid response to potential breaches or misuse.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### CI/CD pipelines
Are automated workflows that streamline the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production or staging environments.

#### Why They Are Important for This Project

- **Consistency & Reliability:** Every change goes through the same automated process, reducing human error.
- **Faster Development Cycles:** Developers can deploy features and fixes rapidly with confidence.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Automated tests in the pipeline catch issues before they reach users.
- **Team Efficiency:** Promotes better collaboration by automating repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.

#### Tools That Could Be Used

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates tasks like running tests, checking code quality, and deploying on each push or pull request.
- **Docker:** Provides a consistent runtime environment for the app, simplifying setup and deployment across different systems.
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean:** Cloud platforms that work well with CI/CD workflows for deployment.
